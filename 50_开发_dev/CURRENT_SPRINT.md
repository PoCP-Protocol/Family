# Sprint Definition of Done

最终必须能通过API和Integration Test完成：

```text
Create Family
→ Add Parent
→ Add Child
→ Create Relationship
→ Assign LifeStage = EARLY_ADOLESCENCE_12_15
→ Grant SERVICE consent
→ Read Family Aggregate
```

并且：

- 每个写操作有Audit
- 支持correlation_id
- 关键写操作具备幂等策略
- 权限失败正确返回
- Schema invalid正确返回
- Unit / Integration tests通过

Sprint DoD status: PASS. M1 is closed.

# M2 Planning Gate — V3.0 Rebaseline

Approved planning task:

1. `M2-000_FIRST_GROWTH_SLICE_DEFINITION`

M2-000 status: PASS_V3_0_CONTRACT_GATE on 2026-08-10.

V3.0 SSOT: `10_规格_spec/04_实施计划/PLAN_SSOT_V3.0.md`.
Active M2 sprint brief: `CURRENT_SPRINT_M2_000.md`.

Previous M2-000 attempt failed because Frontend / UI / UX was insufficient. V3.0 rebaseline kept that ruling as input and restarted M2-000 as a stricter Product Vertical Slice Contract Gate. The V3.0 M2-000 gate is now PASS with BLOCKERS=0 and READY_FOR_M2_WAVE1=YES.

M2-000 outputs:

- First Growth Slice definition.
- Domain Objects.
- Proposed contracts.
- AI minimum architecture.
- Consent/Safety/Human Gate.
- Outcome evaluation plan.
- User Journey.
- Information Architecture.
- Frontend Architecture.
- Screen Map F01-F12.
- UI State Model.
- Frontend Backend Contract Matrix.
- M2 implementation backlog.

M2 delivery rule:

```text
Domain Contract + API + Frontend + E2E + Demo
```

Family Web / Responsive Web is the only approved first frontend target. Native App and Mini Program are deferred.

M2 business implementation status: M2_101_COMPLETED_ONLY.
M2 frontend runtime implementation status: F01_F02_COMPLETED_ONLY.
M2 gate blocker: NONE for M2-000.

User approval recorded: automatic review completed and automatic continuation approved on 2026-08-10.

M2 Wave 1 status: PASS / CLOSED on 2026-08-10.

Completed Wave 1 tasks:

1. `M2-101_START_GROWTH_ONBOARDING`
2. `M2-102_RECORD_PERSPECTIVE_AND_EVIDENCE`
3. `M2-103_EVIDENCE_SYNTHESIS_AND_LIMITED_GROWTH_PROFILE`

Last completed task:

Active integration streams:

1. STREAM-A Schema / Contract Compatibility — AI-03
2. STREAM-B API / Module / Orchestration Integration — AI-00
3. STREAM-C Frontend F01/F06/F07/F08/F09 Real Integration — AI-04
4. STREAM-D Real PostgreSQL + HTTP E2E + Browser QA — AI-05
5. STREAM-E Governance Pre-Review — AI-06
6. Domain Fix Owner: GrowthPriority — AI-01
7. Domain Fix Owner: Intervention / GrowthAction — AI-02
8. Independent Review after Barriers 1-5 — AI-07

Phase B boundary:

- `reports/m2/wave2/M2_WAVE2_CONTRACT_FREEZE.md` is immutable baseline `M2_WAVE2_CF_V1`.
- `reports/m2/wave2/SHARED_FILE_CONFLICT_MATRIX.md` is approved and binding.
- Any contract change requires `CONTRACT_CHANGE_REQUEST`; no role may freely edit the freeze baseline.
- Wave 3 planning may be prepared only after Wave 2 PASS; Wave 3 code remains forbidden without explicit authorization.
- `growth_journeys.subject_person_id` is not approved; subject resolution must use canonical Family/Growth/Onboarding/Profile relations or a minimal resolver boundary.
- `growth_actions` legacy dual-write is allowed only as `TEMPORARY_SCHEMA_COMPATIBILITY` after semantic audit.

Phase B2 status artifacts:

- `reports/m2/wave2/integration/PHASE_B2_INTEGRATION_CONVERGENCE_DIRECTIVE.md`
- `reports/m2/wave2/integration/INTEGRATION_DASHBOARD.md`
- `reports/m2/wave2/integration/status/AI00_STATUS.md` through `AI06_STATUS.md`
